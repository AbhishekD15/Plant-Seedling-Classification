# Plant-Seedling-Classification

ABSTRACT

Most of the economies in the world are based on agriculture. Farming and food productions has become survival of human beings. With unreliable weather conditions and increased pest growth, robust steps are required to help increase production of crops. This project aims to add to this effort by developing a model which will assist to classify plant and weed seedlings. The use of CNN network to visualize the dataset will be an improvement over other models as it leads to an increase in precision and accuracy. This increased accuracy increases the overall reliability of the model. This model has been developed using 4,275 images of seedlings of both plant and weed. The application of this model is just not limited to this specific dataset but can be used to classify other datasets as well. This increases the flexibility of the model making it more valuable.
